* Write a test to complain if roster_config contains element that 
is not present in  info_sheet_config.

* Develop "hook" mechanism for 
  * Parsing a csv column
  * Parsing an entire CSV row.
(Need a way to specify code to run when it is in an external .rb file)
* Have config file import external file.


* Write roster_parsing tests for BB Ultra and "plain" csv.
  * Make sure roster_config works in general -- including nil.

* What should happen if 
  * CSV has a column that isn't listed in the info_sheet_config
  * info_sheet_config has a column that isn't in CSV.
(Write corresponding tests.)

* Remove the "bb-specific" code from workbook_builder. Move
  to an external collection of code. (The main problem is that 
  there are too many ways to handle child id / no child id)
