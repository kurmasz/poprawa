#
# Student
#
# Holds personal and grade data for one student.
#
# Data:
#
# @active:     Boolean indicating whether student is still active (or has withdrawn)
#
# @index:      The index of this Student item in the containing array.
#
# @info:       Student data stored in the "info" worksheet.  Most of this data is
#              optional (displayed in the workbook primarily for the convenience of
#              the gradekeeper).  Commonly included items include
#              - fname    (required)
#              - lname    (required)
#              - section
#              - github   (required if posting progress reports to github)
#
# @marks:      A nested Hash (Hash of Hashes) that stores a student's marks for an assignment
#              using both the assignment type (the worksheet name) and assignment "short" name
#              (the symbol in the second row of the corresponding worksheet).  For example,
#              to access the mark for assignment :hw2 in the "homework" worksheet, use
#              @marks[:homework][:hw2].  This Student class does not specify the form of the
#              mark itself; but, the current report_generator assumes the mark is a String.
#
# @late_days:  A nested Hash that stores the number of late days accrued for a given assignment.
#              (See description of @marks above)
